# Down Bad
## The Game
### Scenario
You are an Alazone employee. Your son is down bad at the hospital and you must save him.

To achieve this, you can steal the contents of the boxes and resell the collected items. Beware of weight differences, Joff Bezas is adamant about weight differences.
### Mechanics
- Choose which box to open or not depending on the weight. 
- You have a limited inventory space, think about it.

## The Team
We are 5 young developers in 42lausanne doing our first game jam (that explains why our game is ugly and shit).
